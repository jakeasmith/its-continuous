        <h2>What is continuous integration?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work
                frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day.
                Each <strong>integration is verified by an automated build</strong> (including test) to detect
                integration errors as quickly as possible.</p>

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Thanks to great packages like <a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>, <a
                href="http://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/padraic/mockery">Mockery</a> and many
            others, writing tests for your PHP application is almost trivial. And if you're willing to invest a little
            bit of time there are some fantastic tools out there that will automatically run those tests for you when
            you push a new commit. Unfortunately, there hasn't been a tool that would constantly monitor your codebase
            as you work and report back the current status of your test suite in real time.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Until now.</strong> Welcome to Its Continuous. The little tweet-sized continuous integration app that
            will change your development practices in a big way.</p>

        <img src="img/tdd.png" alt="TDD screenshot" class="right medium-4"/>

        <p>Continuously running tests while you're writing code reveals bugs early. Unfortunately, the more tests you
            write, the longer it takes to run the entire test suite and the less likely you are to wait around for it.
            Its Continuous will run your tests for you so you don't have to think about it. Just start it up and leave
            it running; you'll see it flash red when tests start failing and have the satisfaction of watching them turn
            green as you bring things back into order. </p>

        <h2>The Setup</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="medium-6 columns">
        <p>Thanks to the suggestions of <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeCarrier/status/427619989391032320">@Luke
            Carrier</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7128447">Gigablah</a> the
            <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeasmith/status/426486307716878336">original script</a> has been rewritten.
            Instead of burning up CPU cycles to constantly run your tests it is now smart enough to only run tests when
            you have updated your code. Setup just requires a few easy steps.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you <a href="http://phpunit.de/manual/current/en/installation.html#installation.composer">install PHPUnit with composer</a>.</li>
            <li>Use <a href="http://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> to install <a href="https://github.com/alandipert/fswatch">fswatch</a>.</li>
            <li>Copy the app to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>.</li>
            <li>Restart your terminal and navigate to your project.</li>
            <li>Type <code>tdd</code> and watch the magic happen.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Your test suite will start running immediately and give you the latest results in the terminal. The great
            thing is that as soon as update your code the app immediately runs the tests again "in the background" and
            seamlessly updates the terminal without any distracting flickers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="medium-6 columns">
        <h3>First install fswatch with brew</h3>
        <pre class="panel"><code>brew install fswatch</code></pre>

        <h3>Paste into ~/.bash_profile</h3>
        <pre class="panel"><code># TDD CI
function tdd {
    clear; vendor/bin/phpunit
    fswatch ./src:./lib:./tests \
    'O=$(vendor/bin/phpunit); \
    clear; \
    echo "$O"'
}</code></pre>

        <h2>Writing Extensions</h2>

        <p>Because Its Continuous has standardized its development on shell scripts its easy to write and share your own
            custom extensions. Simply write the additional functionality, copy it into a <a
                    href="https://gist.github.com/">Gist</a> and send us a pull request with a link to your code. We'll
            feature it right here on the home page for everyone to see. Here's some ideas to get you started:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115373/26415">Send OS X style notifications</a> on failure.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="medium-6 columns">
        <h2>Further resources</h2>

        <p>Its Continuous is a great tool for the lone developer, but to truly get the most out of your tests you should
            use a stand-alone continuous integration server.</p>
